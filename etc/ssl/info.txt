Password to everything is qasklp

1. Private key was generated with OpenSSL, then converted into .p12 format. It's now openssl/client-cert.p12

2. Certificate request client.csr was signed by SmartJog. Returned as Entermedia_00110.crt

3. sj-root-ca_200.crt, sj-token-ws_2008.crt, webservices.smartjog.com.pem, and EnterMedia_00110.crt were imported into openssl/truststore.jks


The webservices.smartjog.com.pem had to be grabbed from the endpoint URL via firefox - "https://webservices.smartjog.com/sjws2.0/"


You should NOT set environment variables for the trusted CA keystores - that will break https for anywhere but smartjog.

Instead, install it in your current JVM:

Go to /usr/lib/jvm/JAVA VERSION/jre/lib/security

cp cacerts cacerts.backup
keytool -import -file sj-root-ca_2008.crt -keystore cacerts
keytool -import -file sj-token-ws_2008.crt -keystore cacerts -alias sj-token
keytool -import -file webservices.smartjog.com -keystore cacerts -alias sj-token

Use the files from the certs folder.
